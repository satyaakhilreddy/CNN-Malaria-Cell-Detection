# CNN-Malaria-Cell-Detection

This notebook exhibits my work on using CNN based image classification on Malaria Cells 
dataset to detect the presence of Malaria in a given image of a human body red blood cell. Since the dataset consists of 
large number of images, the work was done on Kaggle platform with the images being hosted online. To view my work in Kaggle, please
